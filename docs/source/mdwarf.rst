M-dwarf Planetary Relations️
=================================
In v1.1 we also include a pre-conditioned M-dwarf sample fit consisting of  88 planets with precise (> 3-sigma) masses and radii, and stellar effective temperatures < 4200 K. We perform three fits of increasing complexity on this dataset in 2-D, 3-D and 4-D as follows:

2D Distributions --- f(m|r) ---
------------------------------------------
This is the traditional mass-radius fit.
