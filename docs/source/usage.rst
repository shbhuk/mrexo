Usage
=================================

``MRExo`` can be used to fit samples with two to four different observables (along with their measurement uncertainties).

An example of how to query a ``.csv`` file and perform a fit in three dimensions is included in  `sample_scripts\sample_fit.py <https://github.com/shbhuk/mrexo/blob/master/sample_scripts/sample_fit.py>`_
