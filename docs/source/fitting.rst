=================================

``MRExo`` can be used to fit samples with two to four different observables (along with their measurement uncertainties).

An example of how to load a sample and perform a fit in three dimensions is included in  `sample_fit.py <https://github.com/shbhuk/mrexo/blob/master/sample_scripts/sample_fit.py>`_ , where the same script can be adapted to fit two or four dimensions.
