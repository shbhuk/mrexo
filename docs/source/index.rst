Welcome to MRExo's documentation!
=================================

`MRExo <https://shbhuk.github.io/mrexo/>`_ is a Python package for non-parametric fitting and analysis of the Mass-Radius (M-R) relationship for exoplanets.

In this work, we extend the existing nonparametric and probabilistic framework of MRExo to jointly model distributions beyond two dimensions.
Our updated framework can now simultaneously model up to four observables, while also incorporating asymmetric measurement uncertainties and upper limits in the data.

For detailed description of the code please see `Kanodia et al. (2019, 2023) <http://bit.ly/mrexo_paper>`_.
